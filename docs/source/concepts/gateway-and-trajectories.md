# Gateway and Trajectories

The Uni-Agent Gateway connects Agent runtimes to a verl-managed rollout engine. It exposes familiar model APIs to Agents while preserving the token IDs, masks, log probabilities, and rewards required by training.

The Gateway is not an inference engine. vLLM or SGLang generates tokens; the Gateway owns session routing, protocol conversion, and trajectory materialization.

## Two Inference Paths

External API inference bypasses the Gateway:

```text
Task -> Agent -> external model API
```

It is useful for evaluation, but it does not produce Gateway token-level training trajectories.

verl-managed inference and training use the full path:

```text
verl LLMServerManager
    -> AgentFrameworkRolloutAdapter
    -> Uni-Agent Gateway session
    -> Agent Runner
    -> Task / Agent / Sandbox
    -> TransferQueue
```

Use this path when inference must match training or when trajectories are needed as training data.

## Session Lifecycle

For each rollout session, the Agent Framework:

1. Chooses a Gateway actor and creates a session.
2. Receives a session-scoped model `base_url`.
3. Launches the configured Agent Runner, such as `run_task`.
4. The runner injects the session endpoint into `agent.model`.
5. The Agent sends OpenAI Chat Completions or Anthropic Messages requests to the session URL.
6. The Gateway forwards tokenized requests to the verl rollout engine.
7. The managed Agent Runner returns a `TaskResult`, or `None` when it provides no episode annotations.
8. The Framework finalizes the session, attaches reward/status/metrics, and writes trajectories to TransferQueue.

The model-facing endpoints are:

```text
POST /sessions/{session_id}/v1/chat/completions
POST /sessions/{session_id}/v1/messages
```

Sessions are held in Gateway memory until they are finalized or aborted.

## Token-Level Trajectories

A finalized trajectory contains:

- `prompt_ids`: encoded initial prompt.
- `response_ids`: generated tokens plus inter-turn continuation tokens.
- `response_mask`: `1` for model-generated tokens and `0` for Tool results or other continuation context.
- Optional rollout log probabilities.
- Session and materialization metadata. The Agent Framework attaches reward
  annotations only after the managed Runner returns.

Before writing to TransferQueue, the Agent Framework derives the full training record, including `input_ids`, attention masks, position IDs, loss masks, and sparse `rm_scores`.

An optional trajectory postprocessor can filter, reorder, or replace the
finalized trajectories before reward scoring and artifact logging. The order is:

```text
Gateway finalization
    -> Runner trajectory_selection (all or longest)
    -> trajectory postprocessor
    -> reward scoring
    -> trajectory logs and TransferQueue
```

Configure a postprocessor at the Framework level:

```yaml
actor_rollout_ref:
  rollout:
    custom:
      agent_framework:
        trajectory_postprocessor_fqn: my_recipe.trajectory.process_trajectories
        trajectory_postprocessor_kwargs:
          max_total_tokens: 262144  # 256K prompt + response tokens
```

The FQN is imported when the Agent Framework starts, so it must be available in
the AgentFrameworkWorker environment. A configured FQN must be a non-empty
string, and `trajectory_postprocessor_kwargs` must be a mapping. Invalid
explicit configuration, import failures, and non-callable targets fail during
Framework initialization. The callable must follow this contract:

```python
from uni_agent.gateway.session import Trajectory


def process_trajectories(
    trajectories: tuple[Trajectory, ...],
    *,
    max_total_tokens: int = 262_144,
) -> list[Trajectory]:
    return [
        trajectory
        for trajectory in trajectories
        if len(trajectory.prompt_ids) + len(trajectory.response_ids) <= max_total_tokens
    ]
```

`trajectory_postprocessor_kwargs` is passed as keyword arguments. The processor
receives a tuple and must return `list[Trajectory]`; returning an empty list
filters the session out. An `async def` processor is also supported and is
awaited. Returned trajectories must preserve the finalized session
`reward_info` and keep their token arrays aligned because reward scoring,
unfinished masking, and TransferQueue materialization run later. Use
`dataclasses.replace` when constructing transformed trajectories so unrelated
fields remain intact.

`max_total_tokens` above is defined by the example processor.
This compact example drops oversized trajectories; a processor that
crops them must preserve token-array alignment and valid turn boundaries. A
processor may define different keyword arguments or none at all.

The hook is disabled when `trajectory_postprocessor_fqn` is omitted or `null`.
In that case no extension is imported or called, and finalized trajectories
continue through the original scoring, logging, and TransferQueue path.

The Gateway uses a `MessageCodec` to:

- Apply the model chat template.
- Incrementally encode Tool observations between turns.
- Decode model tokens into text and Tool calls.
- Handle OpenAI and Anthropic wire formats.
- Extract multimodal inputs when a processor is configured.

The configured Tool parser must match the model's chat template.

## Multiple Turns and Chains

One session may contain multiple model turns. Tool observations are encoded as continuation tokens and marked with `response_mask=0`, while model completions are marked with `response_mask=1`.

Concurrent requests may create multiple chains within one session. Chains sharing a message prefix reuse the same encoded context where possible, then materialize as separate trajectories during finalization.

When a client rewrites only the most recent Assistant message, the Gateway rolls
the matching chain back to the start of that Assistant turn and re-encodes the
replacement suffix. This preserves token, mask, and rollout-log-probability
alignment without materializing a redundant trajectory. The behavior is enabled
by default and can be disabled with
`actor_rollout_ref.rollout.custom.agent_framework.enable_last_assistant_rollback=false`.

## Reward Flow

The built-in Agent Runner returns:

```python
TaskResult(
    reward=1.0,
    accuracy=1.0,
    finished=True,
    extra_info={...},
)
```

How the Agent Framework consumes the result depends on the reward topology:

- With streaming Reward Loop Worker handles, a configured custom scorer processes the finalized trajectory and receives the Runner result under `extra_info["runner_reward_info"]`. Without a custom scorer, a non-`None` Runner reward is retained directly; the Worker is consulted only when the Runner did not return a reward.
- Without streaming handles, the Framework retains the Runner reward and accuracy and writes a sparse token-level `rm_scores` tensor with the reward on the final token. This is the final result for standalone/inference. TQ training subsequently runs its colocated reward pass and replaces `rm_scores`.

The colocated TQ pass replaces `rm_scores` and writes scorer metrics as top-level
TQ fields, while validation currently reads metrics only from the pre-existing
`extra_fields["reward_extra_info"]`. Consequently, Runner metrics remain visible
and colocated scorer metrics are not included in validation aggregation. Use
streaming handles when Worker-produced validation metrics must be canonical.

Validation metrics are serialized under `extra_fields["reward_extra_info"]`, matching the trainer's TQ contract.
Custom validation scorers should return a stable metric-key set across samples; downstream aggregation may fail when only some samples omit a key.

The result fields have separate contracts:

- `reward` is the Runner's scalar outcome reward. A streaming Worker receives it as scorer input and decides the final score.
- `accuracy` becomes the Runner-provided `acc` validation metric.
- `finished` is a tri-state episode fact, not a validation metric.
- `extra_info` may contain structured scorer input. A streaming Worker receives it as `extra_info["runner_reward_info"]["reward_context"]`; it is never aggregated directly as a validation metric.

The names at the two boundaries are intentional: `Trajectory.reward_metrics` is
the Framework's internal field, while VERL's Worker response calls the same
output channel `reward_extra_info` when it is serialized under
`extra_fields["reward_extra_info"]`. `TaskResult.extra_info` is a separate
Runner-to-scorer context channel and is not copied into either metrics field.

Runner and Worker metrics are not merged in streaming mode. The Worker's
`reward_extra_info` is the complete final metric/metadata set returned by the
Worker. Values are passed through using VERL's permissive interface; downstream
validation aggregates only values it recognizes as metrics.

Agent completion is factual episode metadata; the Framework, not the Task, decides how training consumes it. When the training configuration enables `mask_unfinished_episode`, an episode with `finished=False` is still written and tagged as successful, but its TransferQueue `response_mask` and `loss_mask` are all zero so it does not contribute policy gradients, loss-normalization counts, or auxiliary losses.

Masking stops at the loss. The trajectory keeps its reward in `rm_scores`, so a group-relative estimator such as GRPO or RLOO still folds that reward into the group mean and standard deviation, shifting the advantages of the sibling rollouts sharing its `uid`. The masked trajectory itself gets a zero advantage, and it still costs a full forward and backward pass. Treat unfinished episodes as evidence that keeps the baseline honest, not as samples removed from the batch.

For Agent Runners that always return a reward, the built-in
`uni_agent.framework.task_runner.score_from_runner_result` scorer passes that reward and its
accuracy through the streaming Worker. Configure it through verl's existing
`reward.custom_reward_function` interface. Custom scorers can instead combine
the Runner payload with trajectory-dependent signals. When streaming handles
exist, a configured custom scorer owns the final reward; otherwise a non-`None`
Runner reward is used directly, and the Worker is only consulted when the Runner
did not return a reward.

The former `compute_score` name remains as a compatibility alias for existing
configs; new configs should use `score_from_runner_result` to make the payload
source explicit.

Without streaming handles, a missing Runner reward leaves `rm_scores` at zero
and the Framework logs this at info level. A TQ training reward pass does not
receive `runner_reward_info`, so its scorer must operate on the regular posthoc
reward inputs. When a custom reward function is configured with a colocated
reward model, the Framework warns that hybrid scoring with the Runner result is
not supported by the current TQ contract.

The current `TaskResult` and Reward Loop Worker integration supports scalar
episode rewards only. verl can train from token-level reward tensors, but
producing process rewards through a Worker requires a separate token- or
step-aligned output contract rather than placing arrays in validation metrics.

## TransferQueue

TransferQueue decouples asynchronous rollout generation from the trainer.

Prompt-level records use:

```text
{uid}
```

Trajectory records use:

```text
{uid}_{session_index}_{trajectory_index}
```

A prompt begins as `pending` and ends as:

- `finished` when at least one session succeeds.
- `failure` when all sessions fail.

Individual trajectory records contain token tensors, masks, log probabilities, rewards, Task metadata, Agent name, session ID, and rollout status.

The trainer's ReplayBuffer consumes completed records independently of rollout timing.

## Failure Handling

- A Runner exception aborts its Gateway session.
- One failed session does not discard successful sibling sessions.
- A prompt is marked `finished` when any of its sessions succeeds.
- A prompt is marked `failure` when all sessions fail.
- A batch raises only when every rollout fails.
- An invalid Runner result fails that session and leaves sibling sessions isolated.

This isolation is important for long-horizon workloads, where session latency and failure modes vary widely.

## Configuration

The main Agent Framework settings live under:

```text
actor_rollout_ref.rollout.custom.agent_framework
```

Important knobs include:

- `gateway_count`: Gateway actor pool size.
- `mask_unfinished_episode`: zeroes training masks for sessions that report
  `finished=False`. Sessions without completion metadata remain trainable.
  Defaults to `false`.
- `enable_last_assistant_rollback`: reuses a chain when only its latest Assistant
  message is rewritten. Defaults to `true`; set it to `false` to preserve the
  previous split-on-rewrite behavior.
- `trajectory_postprocessor_fqn`: optional import path for a sync or async
  callable that postprocesses finalized trajectories before reward scoring.
- `trajectory_postprocessor_kwargs`: optional keyword arguments passed to the
  postprocessor.
- `agent_runners`: Runner import paths and arguments. With multiple entries, each
  registry key must match the sample's `agent_name`.
- `dispatch_mode`: inline async execution or Ray tasks.
- `max_concurrent_sessions`: per-Runner concurrency limit.
- `log_dir`: runtime log root. Sessions with a global step write `framework.log`, `task.log`, and trajectory artifacts under `step_<global_step>/<log_id>/`; Sessions whose `global_steps` is `None` write directly under `<log_id>/`.
- `rollout.n`: sessions per prompt.
- `rollout.multi_turn.format`: model-specific Tool parser.
- `transfer_queue.enable`: enables asynchronous trajectory storage.

## Extension Boundaries

Customize the layer that owns the behavior:

- Implement an Agent Runner to launch a different workload against a Gateway session.
- Return `TaskResult` from a managed Agent Runner when it provides episode annotations; a trajectory-only Runner may return `None`.
- Add a Gateway adapter for a new model API wire format.
- Customize Task, Agent, Tool, and Sandbox behavior through their registries.
- Implement a trajectory postprocessor for use-case-specific filtering or
  transformation after finalization and before scoring.
- Customize reward scoring in the Task or a verl Reward Loop Worker.

Do not put Task logic inside Gateway routes or bypass the Gateway token buffers when training-format trajectories are required.
